    "Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets based on blockchain technology, securing transactions through cryptography and featuring anonymity, tamperability and global circulation. The mainstream cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ether. It serves as a new payment tool that bypasses the traditional banking system, effectively reducing the cost of remittances, and has become a high-risk, high-yield asset to invest in due to its much higher volatility than stocks and gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "And changes in people's sentiment toward cryptocurrencies can have a profound effect on prices, liquidity, duration structures and even the entire financial ecosystem. For example, in 2021 when Musk announced that Tesla was suspending Bitcoin payments, the price of Bitcoin plummeted 15% in 24 hours, while DOGE rose over 12,000% in 2021 due to the collective bullish sentiment of the Reddit community and celebrity tweets. And while positive sentiment can lead to more people buying, so the bid-ask spread narrows, transactions are more frequent, and the market comes alive, negative sentiment can cause liquidity to dry up and prices to plummet, paralyzing the market completely. Being able to categorize and then predict the direction of people's emotions, we can know the trend of cryptocurrency prices, liquidity and other changes, and we can effectively respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, individual investors can find the right time to bottom out or reduce their positions; institutional investors can combine sentiment and market liquidity for strategic analysis, such as high-frequency market-making to earn spreads when sentiment is positive and order volume increases; cryptocurrency exchanges can manage liquidity and protect users, such as pop-up windows to prompt risks when sentiment is too high; regulators can carry out market monitoring and policy intervention."

    "First, BERT allows for two-way parsing.BERT uses the Encoder part of the Transformer, which allows the model to take into account all the other elements in the sequence as it processes each element, and can encode each word while taking into account its contextual meaning, whereas the LSTM processes sequences sequentially, and can only access information about the context prior to that element, and cannot access the entire sequence at once, as BERT can. LSTM processes sequences sequentially and can only access the context information before the element, but not the context of the whole sequence at the same time as BERT does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, BERT can process the whole sequence in parallel due to the self-attention mechanism, which greatly speeds up the training of the model, while LSTM needs to process the sequence step by step and consumes more time due to its circular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, BERT can capture long-distance dependencies more effectively, and because it is bigger and more complex than LSTM model with more parameters, it can capture more deep information such as utterance structure and semantic structure, and it has better training effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, BERT performs better in deep understanding of context in this task, so BERT model is chosen."

    "I've been looking for more than 20 datasets on kaggle and Hugging Face, and finally found a 7w+ dataset about Classifying tweets on crypto coins and labeled (bullish vs. bearish sentiment). Because I want to train with BERT, it has many parameters, so the amount of data needed is also larger.\n",
    "    This kind of text data will have noises like User Mentions, links, special symbols, spelling errors, etc. and need to be cleaned. And the dataset may be unbalanced (e.g. large gap between the number of positive and negative samples) and needs to be balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, data cleaning is carried out, and the words with positive and negative attitudes are selected for binary classification model training, and then special words, user names, Links, and non-English text data are removed.\n",
    "    Then the text preprocessing is performed, using BertTokenizer in Hugging Face's transformers library to split and encode the text, and set the maximum sequence length (e.g., max_length=128), truncate the excessively long text, and fill in the short text to ensure that all the input sequences are of the same length, so that they can be batch processed and fed into the model. The training and validation sets are then divided.\n",
    "    The data imbalance is then dealt with and the class weights are calculated using the class_weight='balanced' parameter.\n",
    "    Finally the text encoding and labeling, with the training and validation datasets are saved into the TweetDataset dataset."

    "I encountered some problems in model training and solved them efficiently. Because the batch size of each training step and the batch size of each evaluation step that can be run at the same time is too small because of the low GPU version, the training was slow, so I rented NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB) GPU resources from Autodl platform to fine-tune the model. Because there was an imbalance in the data, I automatically calculated the weights based on the number of samples in each category so that each category's weight was inversely proportional to its number of samples. Because of the concern about model overfitting, I added an early stopping mechanism. When GPU memory was low, I deleted some files from the system disk ...\n"
